# jupyterlite-examples

The examples are to study the size of the final build for variant environment.yml:

- The minimal size is around 5MB for the case with just the jupyterlite core, which gives the basic functionality like text/markdown editor.
- For environment_data.yml, the xeus case gives around 60MB.
